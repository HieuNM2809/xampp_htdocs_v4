# SQL Sharding Strategy

This document explains the sharding strategy used in this project and the design decisions behind it.

## What is Sharding?

Sharding is a database architecture pattern where data is horizontally partitioned across multiple database instances (shards) to improve scalability and performance. Each shard is an independent database that contains a subset of the total data.

## Our Sharding Implementation

### 1. Shard Key Selection

The choice of shard key is critical for efficient sharding. In our implementation:

- We use UUIDs as the primary keys for all entities
- For users and products, we shard based on their respective IDs
- For orders, we shard based on `user_id` to ensure all orders from a user stay on the same shard

### 2. Consistent Hashing

We use a consistent hashing mechanism to determine which shard should store each record:

```javascript
const calculateShardId = (key, totalShards) => {
  // Create hash of the key
  const hash = crypto.createHash('md5').update(String(key)).digest('hex');

  // Convert first 8 chars of hash to a number and mod by totalShards
  return parseInt(hash.substring(0, 8), 16) % totalShards;
};
```

This ensures:

- Even data distribution across shards
- Deterministic routing (same key always maps to same shard)
- Minimal redistribution when adding shards (only a fraction of keys need to move)

### 3. Data Distribution Strategy

Our approach to data distribution focuses on these principles:

- **Data Locality**: Related data stays on the same shard
- **Balanced Load**: Even distribution across shards
- **Minimal Cross-Shard Queries**: Design schema to minimize operations across shards

#### How Data is Distributed

| Entity Type | Sharding Key | Rationale |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Users       | `user_id`    | Natural primary key |
| Products    | `product_id` | Natural primary key |
| Orders      | `user_id`    | Keep all orders from same user on one shard |

### 4. Query Routing

The application layer handles routing queries to the appropriate shards:

1. **Single-Shard Queries**: For queries where the shard key is known (e.g., `getUserById`)
   - Route directly to the correct shard
   - Example: `executeOnShard(getShardForKey(userId), query, params)`

2. **Cross-Shard Queries**: For queries that must search across all shards (e.g., `getAllProducts`)
   - Execute in parallel across all shards
   - Merge and process results
   - Example: `executeOnAllShards(query, params)`

### 5. Transaction Management

Transactions in a sharded system are challenging. Our approach:

- Single-shard transactions are fully ACID compliant
- Cross-shard operations are not atomic (would require distributed transactions)
- The application layer manages the consistency of cross-shard operations

## Advantages of Our Approach

1. **Scalability**: Easily add more shards as data grows
2. **Performance**: Distribute load across multiple database instances
3. **Availability**: Failure in one shard doesn't affect others
4. **Parallelism**: Execute queries in parallel across shards

## Challenges and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Cross-shard queries | Minimize with careful schema design; use efficient aggregation |
| Distributed transactions | Avoid cross-shard transactions; use eventual consistency where needed |
| Shard rebalancing | Not implemented in this demo; would require careful migration |
| Hotspots | Monitor shard loads; consider application-level caching |

## Sharding vs. Replication

It's important to understand the difference:

- **Replication**: Each node has a complete copy of the data (improves read performance and availability)
- **Sharding**: Each node has a subset of the data (improves both read and write performance, enables horizontal scaling)

Our implementation focuses on sharding but could be combined with replication in a production environment for enhanced availability.

## Real-World Considerations

For a production implementation, consider:

1. **Shard Discovery**: Dynamic service discovery for shards
2. **Rebalancing**: Tools to migrate data when adding/removing shards
3. **Monitoring**: Track shard health and load distribution
4. **Backup Strategy**: Coordinated backups across shards
5. **Cross-Shard Joins**: More sophisticated strategies for cross-shard operations

## Conclusion

The sharding strategy demonstrated in this project provides a foundation for horizontally scalable database architectures. By carefully choosing shard keys and designing the system to minimize cross-shard operations, we can achieve significant scalability benefits while maintaining reasonable operational complexity.
